* About

This code is for the Pinguino32 board. It implements the code to control LED-Strips from adafruit: http://www.adafruit.com/products/306

The implementation features the control of LED-Strips using the built-in SPI-controller as well as a software-emulation of the SPI-Protocol.

The implementation uses states to achieve non-blocking I/O.
